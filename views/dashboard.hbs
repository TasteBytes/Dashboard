                <p lang="en">After hearing about the big Loma fire in the Santa Cruz mountains yesterday, I realized I haven't yet written my reviews from two weekends ago. We spent the day at the beach cuz the weather was the best in a while. For our pre-beach food,
                  I wanted to try this gastropub which I've heard is "the bee's knees." (what's up with that idiom? : ))<br><br>West End Tap &amp; Kitchen is located on Ingalls Street in Santa Cruz. It's in an area where there's a large complex of specialty
                  shops like Marianne's Ice Cream and Verve Coffee Roasters. There's a parking lot in the back area of the complex so drive into the back of the local grocery store. (sorry, forgot the name!) They share that lot. <br><br>Upon entering
                  the space, the patio space outside front entrance the looks very inviting and cozy with all the overhead heat lamps turned on. (Santa Cruz is always windy.) Inside, there's plenty of seating and also a bar area to taste all the beers
                  they have. We decided to sit outside because it was too dim inside for me. We ordered their Burger and Chicken Sandwich. However, the only saving grace about our meal was their delicious crunchy French Fries. I ate both helpings!
                  <br><br>Burger : This was just an ordinary burger. Nothing special and not the best we've eaten. It did the job though. <br><br>Chicken Sandwich : I expected a better sandwich honestly. Every restaurant is making their spin on the Chicken
                  Sandwich now, but their's just didn't make the cut. The piece of fried chicken didn't seem like it was breast meat. It was flat and dry instead of thick and juicy.</p>

                <p lang="en">Truly worthy of 5 stars. What an experience! <br><br>We stopped in for a late lunch and sat at the bar. This place is huge, spacious and the staff are super friendly. <br><br>We ordered the baby kale and spinach salad, soup of the day
                  (spicy potato vegetable), chicken confit flatbread and the shishito peppers. <br><br>Baby kale and spinach salad - I don't typically like fruit in my salad, however this was farmer's market fresh everything and the toasted hazelnuts
                  and feta went perfectly with the semi sweet/tart blueberries. <br><br>Spicy potato and vegetable soup - wow, I had to slow down since I came with my partner and should share :) has a nice kick but not too spicy. Very fresh! Burnt my
                  palate but that was my fault for having a spoonful right away. <br><br>Shishito peppers - the BEST ONES I'VE EVER HAD! They were lemony, salty and spicy. All subtle but very well-done. <br><br>Chicken confit flatbread - UM WOW! Sauce
                  espanol, shiitake mushrooms, sugar snap peas, asiago cheese and the balsamic soy reduction was impeccably presented and created on this beauty. <br><br>Oliver, our bartender had wonderful recommendations and as you can tell, I thoroughly
                  enjoyed each of his suggestions.</p>

                <p lang="en">*For Beer Only*<br><br>My goodness, does this place make a decent brew! My boyfriend and I went for beer flights on a Sunday afternoon, and we were not disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the IPA flight. Overall, the selections were interesting,
                  especially the Imp IPA, which was definitely geared towards IPA aficionados. I had the house flight, which was also a great sampling of West End's selection. I particularly enjoyed the American Pale Ale (think craft Blue Moon) and the
                  amber ale. We were there around 12 PM, and while we were seated right away, it definitely picked up by the time we left. Cute, hipster-barn ambiance and friendly staff. Will come back for sure!</p>
